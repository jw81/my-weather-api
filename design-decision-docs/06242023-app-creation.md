# Initial App Creation
I wanted the app to just be a simple, JSON REST API without all of the extra stuff that comes with a standard Rails app.  I did this because I want to try out various front-end framework technologies and I need a simple API to interact with.

## This is how I created a barebones JSON RESTful API in Rails ::

`rails new . --database=postgresql --skip-test --api`
